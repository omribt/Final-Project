# Final-Project
The final project of Introduction to Programming course. 

The goal of the project is to write an image processing program with a user interface, without using any libraries or packages other than those specifically instructed. The program enables the user to choose an image, process it with various options and save it in a file of choice.  

The first file, called GUI.py, contains the user interface code. The second file called imageProcessing.py contains the image processing functions – rotate, mirror picture, resize, edge (a negative image) and a white-blue coloring – so as the upload and save of the given image.
